INTRODUCTION
============

This small utility, written by PHP, is designed to help you label your emails following predefined rules,
rules defined in a setting file.

WHY
===

The 1000,000 dollar question, why? Why create such utility with the presence of procmail? Correct me if I'm
wrong, but procmail cannot be used to post-process an email, such as label it, and save changes on the same file.

This is needed if you are using offlineimap, because offlineimap track changes to emails using the filename,
it is impossible to rename the file and still end up with a synced emails, you will probably end up deleting it.
